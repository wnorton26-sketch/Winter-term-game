4. **End Your Turn:**
   - Click "End Turn" button
   - Your hand is discarded
   - Enemies take their turns
   - Your turn starts again

### **Enemy Turn**

- Enemies show their **intent** (what they'll do)
- They attack, defend, or buff themselves
- Watch the combat log to see what happened

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### **1. Balance Offense and Defense**
- Don't just attack - use Defend cards to block damage!
- Block reduces damage before it hits your HP

### **2. Manage Your Energy**
- You only get 3 energy per turn
- Plan which cards to play
- Sometimes it's better to save energy for next turn

### **3. Understand Status Effects**

**Buffs (Good for you):**
- **Strength** ⚔️ - Increases damage you deal (+1 damage per stack)
- **Dexterity** 🛡️ - Increases block you gain (+1 block per stack)
- **Metallicize** - Gain block at end of turn
- **Barricade** - Block doesn't expire

**Debuffs (Bad for you):**
- **Vulnerable** - Take 50% more damage
- **Weak** - Deal 25% less damage
- **Frail** - Gain 25% less block

**Damage Over Time:**
- **Poison** - Take damage at start of turn
- **Burn** - Take damage at end of turn

### **4. Card Synergies**
- **Strike** + **Strike** = Deal lots of damage quickly
- **Defend** + **Defend** = Build up big block
- **Power cards** = Long-term benefits

### **5. Enemy Patterns**
- Watch enemy intents - they tell you what they'll do
- Some enemies defend when low on HP
- Some enemies buff themselves over time
